## Step 1: Choose & Purchase a Service

1. Visit the [Serververse Store](https://store.serververs.com)
2. Browse our offerings:
   - **Web Hosting** – WordPress, WooCommerce, or CyberPanel-based shared hosting.
   - **Minecraft Hosting** – Paper, Vanilla, Modded, and more.
   - **Cloud VPS** – Root access with blazing-fast SSD or NVMe.
   - **Enterprise/Custom** – Tailored infrastructure for scale.
3. Select your plan and complete the checkout.\
   Your service will be provisioned within seconds.

## Step 2: Access Your Panel

Once your service is active:

1. Head to [serververs.com/panel](https://serververs.com/panel)
2. You'll be redirected to the correct control panel (Web, Game, or VPS)
3. Log in using the **same email** as your store account\
   → If password not set or forgotten, just use **Forgot Password**

<Warning>
   Your panel is different from the store dashboard,
   Each service has its own portal: Web Panel, Game Panel, or Cloud (Proxmox).
</Warning>

## Step 3: Launch & Manage

After login, you'll find your server listed. You can:

- Start, stop, or restart your server
- Access logs and real-time resource stats
