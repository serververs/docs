## 🛒 Step 1: Choose & Purchase a Service

   - 🌐 **Web Hosting** – WordPress, WooCommerce, or CyberPanel-based shared hosting.
   - 🧱 **Minecraft Hosting** – Paper, Vanilla, Modded, and more.
   - ☁️ **Cloud VPS** – Root access with blazing-fast SSD or NVMe.
   - 🏢 **Enterprise/Custom** – Tailored infrastructure for scale.
3. Select your plan and complete the checkout.\
   Your service will be provisioned within seconds.

## 🔐 Step 2: Access Your Panel

Once your service is active:

1. Head to [serververs.com/panel](https://serververs.com/panel)
2. You'll be redirected to the correct control panel (Web, Game, or VPS)
3. Log in using the **same email** as your store account\
   → If password not set or forgotten, just use **Forgot Password**
