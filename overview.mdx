## 1. Select & Purchase a Service

|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Web Hosting**  | Bloggers, Small Businesses        | Shared hosting, WordPress, WooCommerce with CyberPanel |
| **Minecraft**    | Gamers, Servers, Communities      | Vanilla, Paper, Modded (Forge/Fabric) servers |
| **Cloud**    | Devs & Startups                   | Full root access VMs with SSD/NVMe Powered |

## 2. Access Your Service Panel

All control panels are centralized via [serververs.com/panel](https://serververs.com/panel):

- Choose the appropriate panel: **Web**, **Game**, or **Cloud**
- Log in with your **store email**
- If the password isn’t working, no worries — use the **Forgot Password** feature to reset it

---

## 3. Manage & Launch Your Service

Once you're logged in:

- **Web Hosting**: Use CyberPanel to manage files, install WordPress, setup SSL, and email.
- **Minecraft**: Start your server, install mods/plugins, configure settings, and manage backups.
- **Cloud VPS**: Launch VMs, access via console or SSH, manage snapshots or reinstalls.
- **Enterprise**: Provision custom infrastructure, set up monitoring, or scale services—via your tailored panel or partner portal.

---

## 4. Enhance With Extras

You have options to power up your service:

- Enable **DDoS protection** with **Serververse Shield**
- Acquire a **subdomain** like `yourname.serververs.games` or a custom domain via [domain.serververs.com](https://domain.serververs.com)
- Upload files, plugins, mods, or manage with FTP/File Manager
