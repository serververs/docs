# Tunneling

Tunneling allows you to securely route traffic between servers over encrypted private networks instead of exposing services directly to the public internet.

This is commonly used when:

- Backend servers do not have public IPs
- Creating VPN Mesh
- You want to hide internal infrastructure
- You need encrypted server-to-server communication
- A proxy VPS forwards traffic to private nodes

## Supported Tunneling Methods

Serververse supports multiple tunneling approaches depending on your needs.

Choose the method that fits your use case:

  <Card title="Tailscale" icon="plane-tail" iconType="duotone" color="#ffa632" href="/cloud/vps/tunneling/tailscale">
    Tailscale is a zero-config mesh VPN built on WireGuard.

    Best if you want:

    - Fast setup
    - Automatic key management
    - NAT traversal
    - Minimal manual configuration
  </Card>
  <Card title="WireGuard" icon="staff-snake" iconType="duotone" color="#ffa632" href="/cloud/vps/tunneling/wireguard">
    WireGuard is a lightweight, high-performance VPN with full manual control.

    Best if you want:

    - Full self-hosted control
    - Static keys and configs
    - No external dependencies
  </Card>

## When Not to Use Tunneling

Tunneling is not required if:

- Your backend already has a public IP
- You do not need encrypted internal traffic
- You want the simplest possible setup
