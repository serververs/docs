# WireGuard Tunneling

WireGuard is a high-performance VPN that provides encrypted tunneling with minimal overhead and full configuration control.

It is suitable for advanced users who want self-managed tunnels.

## When to Use WireGuard

Use WireGuard if:

- You want full self-hosted control
- You prefer static keys
- Configure your own VPN
- You do not want external dependencies
- You manage multi-node infrastructure

## Install WireGuard

On both servers:

```
apt update
apt install wireguard -y
```

## Generate Keys

On each server:

```
wg genkey | tee private.key | wg pubkey > public.key
```

Store keys securely.

## WireGuard Configuration

Create config:

```
nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Example:

```
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
PrivateKey = <PRIVATE_KEY>
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = <PEER_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
Endpoint = <PEER_PUBLIC_IP>:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

## Enable IP Forwarding

```
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

## NAT Configuration

```
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
```

## Start WireGuard

```
wg-quick up wg0
systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```

## Verify Tunnel

```
wg show
```

## Security Best Practices

- Use firewall rules
- Rotate keys periodically
- Limit AllowedIPs strictly
- Monitor traffic

## Next Steps

WireGuard tunnels can be extended for:

- Multi-region routing
- Site-to-site VPNs
- Private service meshes
